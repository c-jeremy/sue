                    Aurora is a sub-project developed by the Sue Team that enhances the task submission experience in the Sue platform. It allows you to manage your task submissions more efficiently, especially when you're running short on time.

                            Aurora allows you to submit your task and upload your related files <em>asynchronously</em>. This means you can mark a task as "submitted" first, and then upload the actual files later, giving you extra time to complete your work.

                                <strong>Important:</strong> Aurora only works for tasks that have not yet reached their deadline. If a task has already passed its deadline, Aurora cannot help you submit it late.

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-1">
                                    No. Aurora can only help with tasks that have not yet reached their deadline. It cannot be used to submit tasks after they have expired.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-1">
                                    While Aurora gives you flexibility, we recommend uploading your files as soon as possible after completing them. This ensures your submission is fully recorded in the system.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-1">
                                    No. The number of files you specify during the initial submission is fixed. Make sure you know exactly how many files you'll need to upload.

                                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-1">
                                    From your teacher's perspective, they will see that you submitted your task before the deadline. The asynchronous nature of the file upload is transparent to them.
                                </p>

                                    Yes, you can submit up to 10 files per task using Aurora.
